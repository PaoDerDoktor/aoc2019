# Intcom Playground

This folder is meant to contain the latest version of the Intcom class used in many days of the AOC2019 challenge

The ``Intcom`` class aims to replace the ``Intcomputer`` class starting from Day 11. The former simply became to hard to maintain, and I was no longer satisfied with some choices I made when creating it.

``Intcom.py`` has been written from  scratch, and comes with a LOT of tests, including most of the ones present on the official AOC2019 website.

``Intcom.py`` also comes with neat jojokes in comments.
